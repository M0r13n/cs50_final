# Jpeg to ASCII
This my final project for CS50. 
This project consists of two parts: A Image-Converter and a Flask app.

## Converter
The converter converts any given jpeg into fixed-width ASCII art, while preserving the jpeg's aspect ratio.

## Flask App
The Flask App serves as a graphical interface for the converter.

## Installation & Usage
- for Linux/MacOS only
- just run `./start.sh and the app will install itself and start afterwards
- the app can then be accessed under localhost:5000
